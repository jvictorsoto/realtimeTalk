# Description

This project starts as example part of a formation course I gave last summer about NodeJS & Angular and good JavaScript practices (including ES6 & gulp demos).

Initial project show how to build a simple REST chat backend and then add "realtime" communication with socketIO and persistance via mongoose (MongoDB).

Few months later I've decided to continue this project and make it public here in github.com.
